}//What are ajax component?.
//Asynchronous javascript component :Some components are taking time to load or without refreshing the page particular section is getting changed for eg score site where score is getting changed without refreshing the page.
//so especiLLY For ajax component we need to uuse Explicit wait or timeouts
//Q: Do we need explicit wait and implict wait together?
//Ans:We should always avoid implicit wait becoz implicit wait is global wait(all element),so will wait for 10 sec and but we have also added explicit wait for element individually so for eg firstname element it will wait for 30 sec unneccessary becoz implicit wait will be applied first.
//selenium recommend not use both wait together.
